For you, Shrija, on this special day,<br>
I wish I could have been there in every way.<br>
The moments we missed, the laughter we skipped,<br>
I feel them now, in my heart, tightly gripped.<br>
<br>
I remember your smile, soft like the morning sun,<br>
And how you wanted Henley tops for your day of fun.<br>
I’m sorry I couldn’t see you wearing them bright,<br>
Or hug you close and hold you through the night.<br>
<br>
I regret the times I wasn’t near,<br>
When words went unspoken, and I couldn’t hear<br>
The little things you wished for, the quiet hopes you hid,<br>
All the tiny joys that life for you forbid.<br>
<br>
But today, my wish travels on the breeze,<br>
To wrap around you, gently, with ease.<br>
May laughter find you in every corner and lane,<br>
And the warmth of love fall softly like rain.<br>
<br>
May your day be filled with colors of delight,<br>
With hearts, with dreams, with moments bright.<br>
May Henley tops hug you with comfort and grace,<br>
And smiles bloom freely on your beautiful face.<br>
<br>
Though absence stings, my heart is here,<br>
Sending whispers of love only you can hear.<br>
So dance, dear Shrija, let the world spin anew,<br>
For today is yours, and happiness finds you too.<br>
<br>
Happy 17th, my light, my star, my friend,<br>
May joy be yours now, and hope never end.<br>
