  <h1>For You 💌</h1>
  <div class="message">
    Today is your birthday, 23rd February, and it has been 35 days since 19th January—thirty-five quiet days of learning how to exist without the version of life where you were beside me. I don’t know if you will ever come back, and I promise myself I will never ask, never force, never pull at your freedom. Love should never feel like a cage. Still, I want you to know this much, calmly and without expectation: all the love I have learned to hold, I hold for you. I don’t think I will fall in love again ,not out of sadness, but out of truth. Some loves don’t end; they simply become silent, patient, and private. And today is not about my waiting or my wondering .... it’s about you. Your smile deserves a day untouched by heaviness, your laughter deserves to be louder than memory, and your life deserves happiness in whatever form it chooses to arrive.<br>
    I learned how to love,<br>
    and didn’t learn how to let it go.<br>
    I learned how to stay,<br>
    even when it was time to walk gently away.<br>
    I don’t call this pain<br>
    but just a quiet loyalty....<br>
    to something that once felt like home.<br>
    I just want to say I’m sorry : for the moments where I may have hurt you without meaning to, for the times I didn’t understand as quickly as I should have, and for any weight my presence may have added to your heart. This isn’t an apology looking for closure or forgiveness; it’s simply an acknowledgment. I know we both did the best we could with what we knew at the time. There’s no blame here, only love and lessons, and a quiet respect for what we shared. I hope, more than anything, that when you think back, you remember the care more than the confusion, and the sincerity more than the mistakes.<br>
    <br>I hope the world is kind to you. I hope you are surrounded by warmth, by people who make you feel seen, by moments that feel light and effortless. Wherever life takes you, and whoever you become, a part of my heart will always wish you joy .. quietly, sincerely, and without asking for anything in return.
    <br>
    I hope your dreams feel closer today, and your burdens feel lighter, even if just for a while. I hope you laugh without remembering what was lost, and smile without carrying yesterday into the moment. May this year give you growth without pain, strength without struggle, and happiness that doesn’t need explanation. If life ever pauses long enough for reflection, I hope it reminds you of how deeply you were cared for, not as an obligation, but as a choice made with a full heart.
    <br>
    And if my love has to live only as a memory, then let it be a gentle one, something that never weighs you down, something that only ever wishes you well. On your birthday, and on every day that follows, may you walk forward freely, wrapped in peace, with no part of you owing anything back to the past. 🌷<br>
